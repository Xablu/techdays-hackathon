# Building Apps of the Future with with Azure Cognitive Services, Xamarin
Welcome, it is good to see you are here and that you are interested in building a mobile application with azure cognitive services! In this repository you will find all content that is necessary to start creating your own mobile application.

### What are you going to do?
For this hackathon, a few samples have been prepared. You will have the choice to test out the [Azure Emotion API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/emotion/) and/or the [Bing Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/). And although this hackathon was titled Xamarin, we also prepared a sample for the Emotion API in [React Native](http://www.reactnative.com/) for the ones interested!

#### Setting up
For this hackathon you will build an app with Xamarin and/or React Native. So step one is getting your device ready:
* For Xamarin, it will be enough to just [download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) and install Visual Studio for your device. Further instructrions can be found in the specific assignment folders.
* For React Native, the setting up will take a bit longer, but it's documented very clearly. It's as easy as following the [React Native getting started documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). **Note:** Make sure to follow the "Building projects with native code" guide and select your current platform. Although React Native is very easy for cross-platform development, the apps you will create today will be targeted for **Android only**!

#### Getting started
Your next step is choosing your Api and platform and start building your application: 
##### Emotion:
* [Xamarin](Emotion/Emotion.Xamarin/)
* [React Native](Emotion/Emotion.React-Native/)
##### Speech:
* [Xamarin](Speech/Speech.Xamarin/)
