## Speech to text api app
#### Create a speech to text application with the Bing Speech API

##### Challenge:
* 

##### Set up:
1. [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) and install Visual Studio for your platform.
2. [Download or clone](https://github.com/Xablu/techdays-hackathon) the repository and navigate to the [correct start files](https://github.com/Xablu/techdays-hackathon/tree/master/Speech/Speech.Xamarin/Start/SpeechToText) and open SpeechToText.sln in Visual Studio. The starter solution is a Xamarin.Forms solution which has the following Nuget packages installed and ready for use:
    * [Plugin.AudioRecorder] <-- add
    * 
3. To debug the app you will need either a physical android device or a virtual android device. 
(Note: When using a virtual device, make sure to set it up so that it uses the microphone of your host device as you will need it for this app)
4. If everything went alright, you should be able to build and run the starter app in Visual Studio. (The app is just an empty white screen)
